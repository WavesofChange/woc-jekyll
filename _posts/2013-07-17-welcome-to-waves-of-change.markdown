Welcome! You've come across the Deep Dish Waves of Change Summer Internship site. This site is built, managed, and run by a talented group of young women. 

Over the next 6 weeks the Waves of Change S13 Team will learn about community media, journalism, and technology. They will be regularly blogging and covering events in the Harlem area. 

The Waves of Change S13 Team meets twice a week for regular class. We cover technology, journalism, and community media.
