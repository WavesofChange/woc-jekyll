 <h1> Rosa Parks </h1>

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/images/rosa.jpg"> 
                                                                       
  
   <p> On December 1, 1955 the civil activist Rosa Parks, a 42 year old African American woman who worked as a seamstress, boarded the Montgomery city bus to go home from work refused to  give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery. The results of that was that the state of Alabama bus spurred a city-wide boycott to end segregation. So the city didnâ€™t have any choice but to lift the law requiring segregation on public buses. Rosa Parks initiated a new era in the American quest for equality and freedom. </p> 
                               

   <p> What interested me the most was that she was an African-American woman who made a difference in the world  and made her voice be heard by others.
