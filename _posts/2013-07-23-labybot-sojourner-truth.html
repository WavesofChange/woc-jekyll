<p>Sojourner Truth <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sojourner_Truth> was an abolitionist and Womanâ€™s rights activist</a>.She was born into slavery and escasped with her infant daughter in 1826, she was the first black women to recover her son through a case against a white man. She was a woman that had a lot of faith, was dedicated to earning rights for mistreated women such as herself; she was basically a hero she fought to keep her family together.</p> <p> What strikes me most about her was that she never doubted she was a fighter and being a woman which requires more work especially in the time of slavery. She was woman that fought to free people even before Harriet Tubman. Sojourner Truth truth had to endure a lot of pain and disappointments she had to fall in love and then quickly get detached when she got separated by force. She had to leave her a child behind just to get free. She fought and worked hard to get her wish which was to be with her family like children and that is what she got.</p>
