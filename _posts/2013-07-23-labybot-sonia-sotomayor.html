<h3>Sonia Sotomayor</h3>

	<p>Sonia Sotomayor is a very ambitious and passionate person when it comes to the endeavors she seeks to accomplish. Upon realizing and seeing her successes as the first Hispanic female Supreme Court judge, I realized her desires and the way they progressed are similar to how my dreams and aspirations were created.</p> 

	<p>She was able to overcome this feat in the year 2009.  She was inspired to become a judge by watching a TV show called Perry Mason about court proceedings. She was born on June 25th, 1954 in Bronx, New York, only 5 days after mine and one borough away.</p>

	<p>Getting to know a little more about her, I saw so many great things she’s done. Graduating from Yale University in 1980 and later becoming a U.S. District Court Judge in 1982 and moving up from there until she got where she is now. "Although I grew up in very modest and challenging circumstances, I consider my life to be immeasurably rich." – Sonia Sotomayor.</p>

	<p>I am able to see such humility in her and exactly what she means through her words. It may seem like certain situations in peoples’ lives may stop them from pursuing what they want most, but there is a light to every tunnel and a solution to every problem.</p>

	<p>Sonia Sotomayor is a perfect example of the work that is possible to do with limitations of all sorts, through minority, gender, and economic class. We all come across obstacles, but it’s known that they are able to defeat.</p>
