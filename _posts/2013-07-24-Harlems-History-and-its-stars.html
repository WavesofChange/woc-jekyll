<h3>Harlem's History && it's Stars</h3>


<p>So, today I met the very knowledgeable Dr. G. She gave my colleagues and me lots of information on Harlem and some of our fellow African-Americans. I learned the names of such inspirational people and the different roles that they play/played here in our communities. It was amazing to look through the books that Dr. G provided, I was able to see what my community looked like over a century ago. That alone was mind-blowing! Afterwards, DeeDee showed and explained her slideshow presentation of images. One thing that stuck out to me was the "Scroll Singing" that she mentioned; in the Patua communities people would paint stories while singing together.</p>
