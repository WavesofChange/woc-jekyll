<h3>Learning about content</h3>



<p>Today we worked on building our website's content. The specific are that I worked on and learned more about was the navigation bar that'll soon be stretched from left to right on the site. Also, creating links for each word that will be on the navigation bar was another part of my learning experience today.</p>
