<p> Today we had a wonderful woman named Marina Ortiz come in and talk to us about topics including social media, graphic design, and activism. Ms.Ortiz also educated us on East harlem and widened my knowledge on Harlem. She sparked my curiosity to explore more about East Harlem and Harlem in general. One of her websites <a href=”http://www.eastharlempreservation.org”> provides information about neighborhood events and issues of public concern to local residents in East Harlem/ El Barrio and surrounding areas. Marina’s mission is to help spread news about events that occurs in East Harlem to local residents.</p>
