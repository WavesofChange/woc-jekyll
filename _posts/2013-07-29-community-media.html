 <h1> Workshop Day </h1>

 	<p> Todays workshop was with Marina Ortiz. She came in to talk to us about map and to teach us about "East Harlem". Many people dont't know what "East Harlem" is or "Harlem" they are not sure of where it starts nor where it ends. Everyday people swtitch where it starts and ends. "East Harlem" is also known as "Spanish Harlem" or "El Barrio". East Harlem is one of the largest predominantly Latino communities in New York City, mostly made up of Puerto Ricans, as well as Dominican and Mexican immigrants. The neighborhood, all of which lies within Manhattan Community District 11, is bounded by East 96th Street to the south, Fifth Avenue to the west, the East River to the east, and East 142nd Street along the Harlem River to the north. </p>
