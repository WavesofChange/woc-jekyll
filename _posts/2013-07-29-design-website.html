 <h1> Learning about Web Design </h1>

   															
   <p>The lesson that we discussed about today was about designing a web page.I learned how to design a web page. I learned many new things, such as how to make a menu, to a page. The web page consists of many elements such the title, the logo, font size, dates a menu and the list goes on.Some of these elements also consist of grabbing people’s attention, to engage them to your web page.For instance there a many types of designs that you can use for your background like dgeytgfyGnbi and eirtuhye or you can just leave it plain and simple. At times it might depend on the type of web page it is. If it’s a web page for kids then you might want to stick to a variety of colors because that might grab their attention. I also learned that most web pages contain a title, menu, logo, and footer on the same spot. Most logos are located on the top left, the titles are usually in the middle, and the menu is usually underneath the title and the footer in of course on the bottom of the page. In addition most web pages have their information on the top and bottom of the page. As we learned all of the concepts of a web page, we are also fixing and adding much more on our web page.</p>
