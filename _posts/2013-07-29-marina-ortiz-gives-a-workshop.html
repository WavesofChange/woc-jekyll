<h1>Marina Ortiz gives a worshop @ waves of change!!</h1>

<p>In this worskshop alot was discussed but we mostly discussed the community for example we began speaking about how the government was sepnding moneon creating luxury housing a  nd making overpriced homes for minorities all ove harlem. We also spoke about how harlem is changing like the borders are changing one day it starts at 96 th street the next day it starts at 105 th street basically it is getting relatively smaller as the districts change and the days go by. Marina ortiz also spoke about how blogs are helpful to share opinions and she showe dus how she created a map on east harlem displaying what people think of as "not important" such as images of important buildings, parks, bridges, avenues, names of streets and gardens  etc.</p> 

<p> Websites and media aslo help highlight events for example in the east harlem comminuity three kings day where they have a parade to celebrate and they include animals like camels and sheeps and invite school kids to walk in the parade and july 25 th which is the anniversary of the U.s invasion of puerto rico. We also talked about websites and how we can use flyers.Lastly, we spoke about social media is getting the word out using media and being social.We use  social media by commmunicating and interacting  with others using media  to bring people to your website or to for school, organizations to do this  we use posts,pictures emails etc.</p>
