 <h1> Workshop Day </h1>

 	<p>  We had 2 guest speakers today, Doctor G and Dee Dee. These were two amazing women who gave us very good information about our community. In which some of us girls were not informed about but we should really be more aware because Harlem is our community, it’s what surrounds many of us.  I learned many new things about Harlem my community in which I don’t know much about. There are many organizations out there that can help the people in the community. Doctor G is one of the few people that fights for our rights as  a community. She is a very good person to go to if you would ever like to know more about our community.She told us about the struggles that African American people had to go through.In the 20's black people migrated to Boston, Philidelphia and New york. There are many things that happened in our community years ago but any of us are not aware of it and some were not recognized. </p>
