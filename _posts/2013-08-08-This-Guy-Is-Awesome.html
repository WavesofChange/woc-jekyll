<h3>An Inspirational Man</h3>

<p>Today we visited MIST, My Image Studios. We met a very talented individual by the name of Melvin McCray. He's someone who I think I'd work great with, because of the level of experience he has in the film industry. I have a little taste of film compared to him! He could help to rise my level of experience.</p>

<p>I was mesmerized by my peers, his students, and how much they've learned from him as well as their advances. It feels really good to see people of my generation, my culture, my neighborhood, and nationality doing productive things such as film and photography with their lives. And to have these amazing role models, teachers, and activists involved makes it phenomenal!</p><p>I learned of the background of Mr. McCray, where he's been, where he's going, who he's worked with; actors, actresses, journalists, reporters. I reviewed a few of his edits as well as photos and I was beyond impressed. I hope to follow a path similar to his later in life.</p>
