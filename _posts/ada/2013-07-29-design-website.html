<p> Today our  Waves of Change team began to design our web-page.</p>

<p>I learned how to design a web page and how to add content to it such as how to make a menu, title and add color to the web page. A web page consists of many elements such as the title, logo, font size, and a menu . Some website elements exist to grab people’s attention. For instance there a many types of designs that you can use for your background. At times it might depend on the type of website you are designing. If it’s a web page for kids, then you might want to stick to a variety of colors because that might grab their attention.</p>

<p>I also learned that most web pages contain a title, menu, logo, and footer in the same location. Most logos are located on the top left, the titles are usually in the middle, and the menu is usually underneath the title and the footer is of course at the bottom of the page. These elements are usually in the same position because In addition most web pages have their information on the top and bottom of the page. As we learned all of the concepts of a web page, we were also fixing and adding much more on our web page.</p>
