<h1>Doctor G Fights for Harlem</h1>

<img src="/images/blog/wikimedia-apollo-small.jpg">

<p>We had two guest speakers today, Doctor G and DeeDee. They are two amazing women and they gave us very good information about our community. Surprisingly, some of the interns, myself included, are not very well informed about Harlem's history. I believe that we should be more aware because Harlem is our community, it is what surrounds us.</p>

<p>I learned many new things about my community, Harlem, which I donâ€™t know much about. There are many organizations out there that can help the people in the community.</p>

<p>Doctor G is one of the few people that fights for our community rights. She is a very good person to go to if you would ever like to know more about our community. She told us about the struggles that African American people had to go through. In the 20's black people migrated to Boston, Philadelphia and New York. There are many things that happened in our community years ago that many of us are not aware of.</p>
