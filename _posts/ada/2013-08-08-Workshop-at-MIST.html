    <p>Today we met Melvin McCray and his interns at Mist Harlem Cultural Center. McCray is also running a youth summer internship program that received funding from west HArlem Development Corporation- just like our Waves of Change program! His program focuses on photography and film. McCray was an editor at ABC news since 1981. He worked with Peter Jennings and he was also apart of ABC News team honored in 2004 with the Radio-Television News Directors Association's Edward R. Murrow Award. McCary has taught media and television journalism course at Princeton University, Long Island University, the Phelps-Stroke Fund and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. He is a graduate of Princeton University. 
    <p> During our class time with him we saw some of the work he produced with ABC and some of the work his interns has done. We were also able to see how his interns work. They also take pictures of Harlem before and after, which is pretty cool because that way we can see how it looked before and how it looks now. Their goal is to set up a gallery of the pictures they have taken so that people can see what they have done and learn about the history of Harlem. The show will be at Mist..</p>
