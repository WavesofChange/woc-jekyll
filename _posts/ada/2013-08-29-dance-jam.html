 <h1>Def Dance Jam</h1>

<p>Today our Waves of Change team had a wonderful experience at Aziza's dance class. We saw some wonderful performences that her dancers created. At the fundraiser, we also saw some of the dancers perform.</p>

<p> Aziza is a wonderful dance teacher who wants to help deaf people out. Now that I saw the performence, I have more respect for them and appreciate the dances they made for us.</p>
