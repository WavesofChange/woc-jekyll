<h3>Marina Ortiz Speaks</h3>

<img src="/images/marina-workshop/nefy-questions-marina.jpg">

<p> Today <a href="http://www.virtualboricua.org/">Marina Ortiz</a> came to talk about the history of East Harlem. Her discussion was very informative. I learned a lot about the personalities of East Harlem as well as some historical people that come from that region. </P>

<p>This workshop was really helpful for me specifically because I had to write an article about Columbia’s University’s expansion in Harlem. I was able to learn that East Harlem is not only where people come from, it's their home and their community. After hearing everything Marina had to say, I was able to comprehend more how some people might feel towards Columbia's invasion of their home and privacy.</p>
