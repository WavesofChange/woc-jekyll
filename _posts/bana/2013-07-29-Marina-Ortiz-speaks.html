<p> Today <a href="http://www.virtualboricua.org/"> Marina Ortiz</a> came to talk about the history of East Harlem. Her discussion was very informative; I learned a lot about the personalities of East Harlem as well as some historical people that come from that region. This workshop was really helpful for me specifically because I had to write an article about Colombia's expansion in Harlem. I was able to learn that East Harlem is not only where people come from, it's their home and their community. After hearing everything Marina had to say, I was able to comprehend more how some people might feel towards Colombia's invasion of their home and privacy. </p>
