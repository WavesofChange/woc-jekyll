<h1>Workshop at MIST Harlem</h1>

<img src="/images/blog/Melvin-Mccray-mist.jpg">


<p>Today we took a trip to <a href="http://www.myimagestudios.com/">MIST Harlem</a>. There, we met <a href="http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/profile/128-melvin-mccray/">Melvin McCray</a> and the summer interns working on film projects. </p>

<p>The day I spent at MIST was very interesting; we got to have our individual portraits taken so that the interns could practice what they've learned. After that, we moved on to watch some videos of the interviews Melvin has done with successful Harlem residents. Among those interviewed was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Maria_Horsford">Anna Marie Horsford</a>. In the video, Anna talks about how she will never forget her Harlem upbringing and the impact the community has had on her life.</p>

<p>As I watched this video, I was very inspired by the amount of humbleness the people of Harlem had. Although some moved on to become Hollywood stars, they all still recognize the community of Harlem as their home. I was also very fascinated by the work the interns learned within a mere 5 weeks of the program.</p>
