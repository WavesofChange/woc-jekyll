<h3>Sister Aziza</h3>

<p>In mid-July I had the pleasure of meeting Sister Aziza, founder of <a href="http://www.defdancejam.org/ddjw/abt/"> Def Dance Jam</a>. Sister Aziza has been in the dancing industry for many years. She used to travel the world and perform. </p>

<p> During the 1980s, Aziza felt as if she had a greater calling in life aside from just dancing. She began to study disorders. While studying disorders, Aziza realized that it wasn't the differences but the similarites that brought people together. She went on to begin Def Dance Jams, a dance program that highlights the similarites of people with and without disorders. </p>

<p> Def Dance Jams has been around for over 20 years. In the program there are people of all ages, races, and backgrounds, but the music is what unites them. The vibrations of the beat speak to them and they are able to perform naturally. </p>

<p> In August, sister Aziza invited the Waves of Change interns to a special dance class. During the class we learned basic sign language and the sign language version of the song "Ooh Child (Things are going to get easier"). While doing the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPXgpbMxy8I&noredirect=1"> dance class</a> I realized that it was extremly difficult to dance and do sign langauge at the same time. Noticing this just made me gain a greater respect for those who are disabled yet still can dance perfectly. </p> 

<p> Sister Aziza is a remarkable woman doing extraordinary things. She is changing the lives of many people and bringing hope to all those who need it. </p>
