<p>Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden are two Americans in their 20s. Both are fascinated by computer use and held jobs that gave them access to some of their countrys most secrect. Manning and Snowden chose to share that material with the world and are now paying for.</p>

<p>Edward Snowden was a former CIA employee and National Security Agency contract employee. He told a Guardian journalist that the NSA was operating classified surveillance programs that track cell phone calls and monitor the email and internet traffic of virtually all Americans. To tell everyone what happened, he left his job and life in Hawaii, and went to China and is now in Russia, where he has been granted temporary asylum.</p>

<p>U.S. Army Pvt. Bradly Manning leaked hundreds of classified documents about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and sensitive correspondence written by U.S. diplomats, information that WikiLeaks published. The New York Times also analyzed and reported some of that information. So did Der Spiegel and The Guardian newspapers. A milltary judge acquitted Manning of aiding the enemy, but convicted him of violations of Esionage Act. Manning could get up to 136 years in jail.</p>

<p>I honestly think that this is not that serious. If anything Snowden was just showing us how the government is basically watching everything we do. Which I dont think the government should be doing. And Manning put out documents that are not that big of a deal. I personally think Manning and Snowden just wanted to make a point and show America what the government does and is doing. I mean I wouldnt want people listening to my conversations on the phone, and some might not like that either. I just think that the government should rethink what they do because if it wasnt for Manning and Snowden, we would have never knew this. So if anything they helped us to see what was really going on. I also think it was a good thing for them to want to be honest with people about this kind of things, I probably would have dont the same thing.</p>
