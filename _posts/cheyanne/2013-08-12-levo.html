<p>Today on google hangout, I met Rushaine McBean. Ms.McBean is a Web Developer and explained what she does to us. Most of what she does is programing but it has to do with math also. I didnt understand some of the things Ms.McBean was saying because I wasnt that into it. She explained all the hard classes you have to take to learn about Web Development. One of the classes was Junior Math Calculus and Statistics, thats like another level of math. I think if being a Web Developer was ever a chose, I would fail because to me math is like the hardest subject ever. Even though what Ms.McBean does doesnt interest me much, I still enjoyed her speaking about it and just letting us know how much work you have to put into it.</p>
