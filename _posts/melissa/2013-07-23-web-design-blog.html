<h1><strong>The makings of our website</strong></h1>

<img src = "/images/nav.png">

<p>The process of developing our waves of change website has begun! But now we’re treading into a very valuable piece of the website, its design. Today, our Waves of Change team spent time figuring out the layout and design that we want to convey on our webpage.</p>

<p>With critical thinking and the consumption of web jargon, we were able to get the races started, and down packed after a brainstorming session. We wanted our website to show a simplistic, easy-on-the-eye, but yet exciting feeling. Concluding with special techniques that’d we have to incorporate when we start to learn about CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). However for now, it was all about the content.</p>

<p>We distributed information throughout several website tabs, and made sure, no page was left to inconsistent on our layout. To commence the actual interpretation, we split into two teams, one handling the interior of the important “about” page, and the other the “home” page. My team was granted the “about” page. We were able to code accordingly and fix our website, by using a server through our Github account and having it being held up through the program terminal, which we use on our Ubuntu virtual machine. After so, we start to actually code the html on another program called sublime text, and write out exactly what we want our page.</p>

<p>After a few trial and errors, we got it to look exactly how we wanted. It was pretty fun and exciting to see how our physical work can end up in such a broad place.</p>
