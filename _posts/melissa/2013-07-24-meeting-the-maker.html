<h1>A Day with DeeDee, Founder of Deep Dish Waves of Change</h1>

<img src="/images/blog/DeeDeeHalleck.jpg">

<p>Today, we were granted with the visitation of the founder of the program we are currently working in, DeeDee Hallack. It was awesome to see such a successful woman come into our workshop and hold a class on media for us.</p>

<p>We got to see some powerful and ludicrous images of the many things that are held in social media. Pictures of protests, and violence between police and victims, picture of books that brought extreme controversy when published, many differing things of how social media is exemplified.</p>
