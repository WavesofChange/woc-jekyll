<p>Visiting MIST in NYC. This day, the Waves of Change group got to see Melvin Stokes Video Arts Camp! On our journey into the unknown we got to meet Melvin Stokes himself. A former videographer, he’s now bringing his talents to the youth of Harlem.</p>

<p>He’s been providing this internship that records the history of Harlem and the effect it has on those livingthere. Learning new and exciting things is one of the many things people of Harlem happen to encounterjust by researching and investigating on this multi-cultural neighborhood in New York City.</p>

<p>We were able to see the fruits of the knowledge the interns learned so far. This was through using various photography equipment to be able to capture pictures of us. We saw the pictures and got to takea group one as well. It was really interesting to see another organization that’s documenting in the same neighborhood as our internship.</p>

<p>Melvin definitely has the experience and skills to be able to make a great project with the help of fellow college and high school students. I saw that what they were doing so far was great.</p>
