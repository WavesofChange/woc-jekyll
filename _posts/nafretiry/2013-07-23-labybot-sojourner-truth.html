<p>Sojourner Truth <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sojourner_Truth> was an abolitionist and a womenâ€™s rights activist</a>. She was born into slavery and escaped with her infant daughter in 1826: she was the first Black woman to recover her son through a case against a White man. She was a woman that had a lot of faith, was dedicated to earning rights for mistreated women such as herself, and fought to keep her family together. Basically she was a hero.</p> 

<p> What strikes me most about her was that she never doubted herself. Even though she was a woman, she was a fighter. She fought to free people even before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Tubman">Harriet Tubman</a> did. Sojourner Truth had to endure a lot of pain and disappointments: she fell in love and had to quickly get detached when she was separated from her loved one by force, and she had to leave her child behind to free herself. After she gained her own freedom, she fought and worked hard to be with her children. After years of fighting, she finally reached her goal.</p>
