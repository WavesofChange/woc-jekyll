<p>We spoke about all the different components of designing. We went over colors, attention-grabbing styles and fonts. We also discussed the feel of the website and what emotions we want people to feel from it. </p>

<p> We discussed page layout and content:what we want to share and how we want to display it. As a team we layed out each page and every aspect of them from color to stly,pictures and not to forget writing. I learned a lot about what you need to think about when you are ready to create a website and why this is crucial when working in the area of website.</p>
