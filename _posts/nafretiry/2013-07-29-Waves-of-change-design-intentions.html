<p>We spoke all about the different components of designing. We went over colors like what grabs peoples attention and what sense you give off such as a sense of urgency or some thing else,ant to show pictures, what type of website you want to show you have a way where people want to see more, what you want to display on your website such as how plain or colorful / is it or is it nott transparent.How we get good attention in a way where people want to see more, the projects we work on and how we want to share them with others using eveidence and a written part.I learned alot of what you need to think about when you are ready to create a website and why this is crucial when working in the area of website.
As a team we layed out each page and every aspect of them from color to boxes,pictures and not to forget writing.</P>
