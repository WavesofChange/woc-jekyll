<p>We spoke about all the different components of designing. We went over colors, attention-grabbing styles and fonts. We also discussed the feel of the website and what emotions we want people to feel from it.</p>

<p>We discussed page layout and content: what we want to share and how we want to display it. As a team we layed out each page and every aspect of them from color to style, pictures to writing. I learned a lot about what you need to think about when you are ready to create a website and why this is crucial when working in the area of website design.</p>
