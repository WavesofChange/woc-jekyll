<h1>Marina Ortiz gives a worshop at Waves of Change!!</h1>

<p>In this worskshop, Marina Ortiz discussed alot, but she mostly discussed the community. For example, she began speaking about how the government is spending money on creating luxury housing and making overpriced homes for minorities all over Harlem. She also spoke about how Harlem's borders are changing. Harlem's district is getting smaller: one day it starts at 96th street and the next day it starts at 105th street.</p>

<p>Marina Ortiz spoke about how blogs are helpful to share opinions. She showed us how she created a map on East Harlem displaying places that people think of as "not important", such as images of important buildings, parks, bridges, avenues, names of streets and gardens  etc.</p>

<p>We learned how websites and media help highlight events. For example, in the East Harlem community, Three Kings Day is celebrated with a parade that has  animals like camels and sheep, and school kids are invited to participate. July 25th, the anniversary of the Unites States' invasion of Puerto Rico, is rmembered by Hispanics in East Harlem.</p> 

<p> Marina Ortiz talked about how we can use flyers to promote and share our events and ideas. Lastly, Marina Spoke about how to get the word out using social media. We can use social media to commmunicate and interact with others by using social media such as facebook and twitter. We learned that the best way to get someone to go to a website is by using posts, pictures and emails to grab their attention. </p
