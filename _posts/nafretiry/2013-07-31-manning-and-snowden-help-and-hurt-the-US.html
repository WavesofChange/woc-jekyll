<p>A whistle blower is a person who exposes misconduct, alleged dishonest or illegal activity occurring in an organization. Bradley Manning and Edward snowden men in their late 20's Bradley manning is a former united states army soldier born on December 17,1987 who is on trial accused of allegedly of having passed classified material on to the website wiki leaks. Manning says he leaked the material to expose the wrong doing by the military and U.S military dimplomats.He was resuming with more evidence that the classified information he disclosed through wiki leaks damaged U.S foreign relations. If convicted he faces life in prison in military custody with no chance of parole. The U.S thinks manning knew he was aiding al-quaeda when he released 700,000 documents to an anit-secrecy website. </p>

<p>Edward snowden is a fromer C.I.A and NSA computer technician born on June 21,1983 who is trapped in an airport. Edward snowden went public as the source behind the daily drumbeat of disclosures about the nations surveillance programs. Snowdens reasoning on the reason he did what he did was "because the public needs to decide wether these programs and policies are right or wrong.In my opinion these cases are very similar and are interesting .I think that these two men both helped and hurt the United States. Snowden and Manning hurt the U.s because some of the information leaked can cause bad foreing relations, communication and can help/aid the enemy therefore hurting the U.S. Edward Snowden and Bradley Manning helped the United states because some of the information they leaked are pieces of information the American people need to see or should be aware of, either way you look at it everyone has an opinion and some think it was good and some think it was bad and others think both we can never really tell what it is , it depends on the person. </p>
