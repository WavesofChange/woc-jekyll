<h1>Harlem Through The Eyes of a Different Set of Youth!</h1>

<img src="/images/mist/mist-studio.jpeg">

<p>We went to MIST and met another set of students and it was pretty interesting. Melvin McCray is a very talented and interesting character. He told us stories of people who visited MIST Harlem and how tickets were sold out for shows there. Melvin told us he was an editor for ABC since 1981. What Melvin does is interesting; he does photography and videography with his students.</p>

<p>Melvin showed us some interesting videos of interviews and of how he is using pictures and things to create a visual gallery of how people see Harlem through their eyes. He tried to show us Harlem in the past from another's eyes, and Harlem now through our eyes. Melvin and his students found pictures of buildings from back then and took pictures of what they look like now.</p>

<p>We took pictures, which was unexpected. It was interesting because of the rotation process and the roles that each person had. For example, if one person was taking my picture, another was taking a picture of them, others would help adjust lighting and some would observe; then they would rotate. That way everyone played every role. We got to watch live video footage of Melvinâ€™s work as an editor for ABC. We watched this one video about a man who discovered remedies in a forest. The man  explained and showed how he uses tree bark, leaves, branches, and certain liquids for  healing people. I was amazed at the work Melvin had done and was planning to do. From my eyes it did not seem easy at all, and his students are lucky to be working with him. My experience at Mist was inspiring.</p>
