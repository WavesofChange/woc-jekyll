<img src="/images/mist/mist-studio.jpeg">
<p>We got to Mist and met another set of students and it was pretty interesting. Melvin McCray was a very talented and interesting character.He told us stories of people who visited MIST harlem and how tickets were sold out and stuff. Also, he told he was an editor for abc  since 1981.What he does is interesting he does photography and videography with his students. He showed us some interersting videos of interviews and how he used pictures and things to create a visual of what people are trying to show us through their eyes. also Melvin tried to show us harlem back then from anothers  eyes and harlem now through our eyes.Melvin and his students found pictures of buildings back then and took pictures of what they look like now. We took pictures which was unexpected, i9it was interesting because the rotation and each person had a role. If one person was taking my picture another was taking a picture of them and other would help adjust lighting and some would observe then they would rotate that way everyone played every role! We got to watch live video footage of melvins work as an editor for abc we watched this one video about a man who discovered remedies in a forest he explained and showed how he uses tree bark leaves branches and cerain liquids to heal people. I was amazed at the work Melvin was doing and planning to do because from my eyes it did not seem easy at all, and his students are lucky to be working with him. My expierience at  </p>
