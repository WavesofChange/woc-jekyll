<h1>Netia McCray talks about being a black female entrepeneur</h1>

<p> <img src="/images/workshop-netia/interns-listening-side-shot.jpg"></p>

<p> <a href="https://twitter.com/mbadika"> Netia McCray</a> is a black female entrepeneur. Netia started various businesses since she was a child like selling candy. Netia basically takes peoples’ ideas and tries to put them to life. She has made sure that she has gotten the resources she needs to make these dreams come true. She was telling us if she wanted to she could test an airplane on campus. In her <a href="http://mbadika.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/i-dont-know-a-single-black-entrepreneur-personal-reflections-on-being-a-black-entrepreneur/">blog post</a>, Netia tells us how she is inspired by the her parents, who were entrepeneurs when she was growing up with her father working with cars and her mom buying and selling things to make more profit. She also had a magazine called Black Enterprise which she always was anxious to read just to find out about successful entrepreneurs and that was “another source of inspiration for her”.</p>

<p> Netia believes you do not need a degree to build a successful startup. Netia had to deal with people talking down on her, and teachers doubting and disrespecting her. She got told she couldn’t have a successful business and get sponsors if she didn’t have a white male co-founder. She <a href="mbadika.wordpress.com/people/">has worked hard</a> to get where she is now and she plans to have people not being able to say they dont know any black tech entrepeneurs. She explained to us how going to school with men was kind of hard; she said you have men who think women are not smart, or men who think they are better than women. The statistics of Africans Americans being unemployed and bad mouthed  saddened her, which made her want to become an entrepreneur even more. She is an amazing person dedicating herself to make the African Americans known in a good way or even known at all!  </p>
