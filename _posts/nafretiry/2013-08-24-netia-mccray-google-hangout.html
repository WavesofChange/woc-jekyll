<h1>Netia McCray talks about being a black female entrepeneur</h1>

<p> <img src="/images/workshop-netia/interns-listening-side-shot.jpg"></p>

<p> <a href="https://twitter.com/mbadika"> Netia McCray</a> is a black female entrepeneur. Netia started various businesses since she was a child, like selling candy. Netia basically takes peoples’ ideas and tries to bring them to life. She has made sure that she has gotten the resources she needs to make these dreams come true. She told us if she wanted to she could test an airplane on campus. In her <a href="http://mbadika.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/i-dont-know-a-single-black-entrepreneur-personal-reflections-on-being-a-black-entrepreneur/">blog post</a>, Netia tells us how she is inspired by the her parents, who were both entrepeneurs when she was growing up. Her father worked with cars and her mom bought and sold things to make more profit. She also had a magazine called Black Enterprise that she always was anxious to read just to find out about successful entrepreneurs and that was another source of inspiration for her.</p>

<p> Netia believes you do not need a degree to build a successful startup. Netia had to deal with people talking down on her, and teachers doubting and disrespecting her. She was told that she couldn’t have a successful business and get sponsors if she didn’t have a white male co-founder. She <a href="mbadika.wordpress.com/people/">has worked hard</a> to get where she is now and she plans to have people not be able to say that they don't know any black tech entrepeneurs. She explained to us how going to school with men was kind of hard; she said you have men who think women are not smart, or men who think they are better than women. The statistics of African-Americans being unemployed and bad mouthed saddened her, which made her want to become an entrepreneur even more. She is an amazing person dedicating herself to make African-Americans known in a good way or even known at all!</p>
