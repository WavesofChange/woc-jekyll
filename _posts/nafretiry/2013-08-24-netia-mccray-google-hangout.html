<p> <img src="/images/workshop-netia/interns-listening-side-shot.jpg"></p>

<p> Netia McCray is a black female entrepeneur. Netia started various buisnesses since she was a child including sellling candy and other things. Netia basically takes peoples ideas and tries to put them to life. She has made sure and that she has gotten the resources she needs to make these dreams come true, she was telling us if she wanted to she could test an airplane on campus. Netia is inspired by the her parents who were entrepeneurs when she was growing us her father working with cars and her mom buying and selling things to make more profit. She also had a magazine called black enterprise which she always was anxious to read just to find out about sucessful entrepeneurs and that was another inspiration.Netia believes you do not need a degree to build a sucessful startup. Netia had to go through people talking down on her ,teachers doubting and disrespecting her. She got told she couldnt have a sucessful buisness and get sponsors if she didnt have a white male co-owner. She has worked hard to get where she is now and she plans to have people not being able to say they dont know any black tech entrepeneurs.She explaines to us how going to school with men was kond of hard because you would have men who think women are not smart or men think they are better than women for some reason that i cant even explain. The statistics of africans americans being unemployed and things of that nature are was saddening to her, which made her want to become and entrepeneur even more. She is an amazing person deicating herself to make the Afican americans known in a good way or even know at all!  </p>
