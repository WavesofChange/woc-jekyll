<h3>About Grace Hopper</h3>

<img src="/images/blog/grace-hopper.jpg">

<p>On December 9, 1906, Grace Brewster Murray made her entrance into this world, in New York City to be exact. While growing up, she enjoyed playing with machines and at the age of seven took apart a number of alarm clocks because of her keen interest in learning how things work. Who knew that she’d later become a computer scientist, and be one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I, a room-sized automatically controlled calculator?</p>

<p>In my opinion, there are not enough women in the engineering field. Grace Murray-Hopper’s ability to stick with the profession of her choice and use it to the fullest is what excites me the most about her. While working on the Harvard Mark II, Hopper popularized the term “debugging” for computer systems. This term has been used for centuries and her act to make it known will forever echo in my head!</p>
