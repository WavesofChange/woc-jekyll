<h1>East Harlem's History &amp; The NYT Science Fair</h1>

<img src="/images/nyt-science-fair/raelene-nyt-science-fair.jpg">

<p>We met Marina today. She gave us information about east Harlem and the Latino community. She showed us many of the murals that were created by people who formerly lived in the areas. After her presentation, we proceeded to go to the science fair that took place in The New York Times building downtown. There were many different organizations there. I learned a simpler way to resize images through coding! There were lots of technical things there at the fair. I also came across a news reporter that documented the event, but I was too "starstruck" to talk to him!</p>
