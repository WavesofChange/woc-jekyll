<p>Today, I joined both instructors and spoke on a live radio show regarding the Deep Dish Waves of Change organization, my involvement with it, my achievements, and future goals. I was a little antsy and anxious being that it was my very first radio show, but I got through it. Overall, it was cool and I hope to go on another one someday!</p>
