<p><a href= "http://www.biography.com/people/ada-lovelace-20825323"> Augusta Ada Byron </a>, better known as Ada Lovelace, was significant for writing a scientific paper in 1843 that predicted the development of computer software and computer music. Born in London on December 10, 1815, Ada showed a strong interest in mathematics at an early age. Around the age of 17, Ada met a mathematician and inventor named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>. Charles served as a mentor to Ada. Ada began to translate languages through a difference engine invented by Charles. She also described how codes could be created for the device to handle letters and symbols along with numbers. Ada is well know for theorizing a process called looping that computer programs use today. These are a few facts on how Ada Lovelace is a significant female today.</p>
