 <h1> DeeDee Halleck's Media Workshop </h1>

 	<p> Today the wonderful founder of Waves of Whange, DeeDee Halleck, came in and enlightened us with a wonderful workshop on community media. From this workshop, I was able to understand why Waves of Change was created and the motives behind it. Waves of Change uses maps and community media such as blogging to connect with people world wide.</p>

  <p>This helps them become aware of other things around the world. People worldwide learn new techniques, strategies and styles all from community media. The reason people aren't aware of what's going on around the world is because they don't know what to look for. With the creation of Waves of Change, people all around are able to connect and become aware of what's going on.</p>

 	<p>I also learned about scroll singing in India which I found to be fascinating and unique. This image shows a man unrolling the scroll as he sings about his topic:</p>

 	<p> DeeDee talked about visiting a village in India called Nia, the village of painters. Scroll painting is when a person or people draw and paint a scroll image of an issue and slowly unroll the scroll a frame at a time as they sing describing whats going on in the world. This is their way of spreading news of what goes on in the community and around the world. This video shows the creation of scrolls, various topics based on creating the scroll, the drawing and painting of the scrolls and the singing out of the scrolls when they are completed.</p>
