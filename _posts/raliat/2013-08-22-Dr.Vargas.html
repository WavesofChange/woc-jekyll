<h1> Suprise Visit </h1>

<p> Today during our lunch break we recieved a suprise visit from Dr. Claudina Vargas. She discussed her life as a child and how life was like growing up. Dr. Vargas grew up in a house hold with a grandmother who could not read or write and a mother who could barely do either or. Dr. Vargas knew she wanted to be the starting change and at the age of 16 she traveled abroad to Spain to study her bacholers degree. All she knew was that she'd be going to a whole new state and didn't know what to expect. All she had was a couple hundreds of dollars saved up and a dream. During her early 20's she recieved an internship to travel to the United States which got renewed every 6 months.</p>

<p>  Dr. Vargas's discussion was very inspirational and touching. Being that she grew up in a house hold of people who couldn't read and write or barely do either her accomplishments were very special and motivational. She was able to do amazing things at such a young age.</p>
