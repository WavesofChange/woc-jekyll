<h1> A Surprise Visit </h1>

<img src="/images/blog/vargas.jpg">

<p> Today during our lunch break we received a surprise visit from Dr. SClaudina Vargas. She discussed her life as a child and what life was like growing up. Dr. Vargas grew up in a household with a grandmother who could not read or write and a mother who could barely do either. Dr. Vargas knew she wanted to be the change in her family and at the age of 16 she traveled abroad to Spain to pursue her Bachelor's degree. All she knew was that she was going to a whole new country and didn't know what to expect. All she had was a couple hundred dollars saved up and a dream. During her early 20's she received an internship in the United States which got renewed every 6 months and that is how she ended up staying in America.</p>

<p>  Dr. Vargas's discussion was very inspirational and touching. Because of the fact that she grew up in a household of people who could barely read and write, her accomplishments were very special and motivational. She was able to do amazing things at such a young age.</p> 

<p>Dr. Vargas now resides in the Dominican Republic and is running an <a href="http://macile.org/en"> educational program</a> for children who reside there.</p>
