   My name is Ada Gonzalez. I was born on February.14, 1996 yes that’s right I’m 17 years old. I was born and raised in New York City; I guess that’s why I love the city. I have two sisters one is older than me and the other is younger than me which makes me the middle child. </p>

   <p> I am proud to say that I come from a Mexican family. I attend school at Life Sciences Secondary School located on the east side in which I’m in my last year of High School. School is pretty fun, my favorite subject is Art, drama and English. I also participate in my schools soccer team. I enjoy talking and hanging out with my friends. I like to listen to music and watch movies on my free time. I love food, my favorite food is pasta and tacos. </p>
