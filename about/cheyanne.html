  <p>My name is Cheyanne Konate. I am 14 years old going into the 8th grade. My dream is to be involved in media or music entertainment. Some say I talk a lot, so becoming a writer comes to mind. A hobby that I enjoy is writing songs; it helps me express myself easier. My favorite color is Blue and Pink. I like blue because it’s very exciting and calming. I like pink because I just think it’s a pretty color.</p>

  <p>I am excited to be a Waves of Change intern because I like to write and this program involves a lot of writing, so Waves a Change helps me learn more about a lot I didn't know. What makes me proud of myself is that I like to be involved in a lot of programs because I know it will help me in the future. I was always told to take advantage of what comes my way but only for good. What gets me up in the morning is that I know I have a lot to see in the future. I have a lot of dreams and I want to be able to tell people how I did it and why.</p>

  <p>I used to go to school at Annunciation School but sadly it got closed down because it didn't have enough money to keep on. So now I attend St. Gregory the Great which is a Catholic school.</p>

  <p>My family is from Accra, Ghana. When I was six, I went to school there for one year. I ended up getting held back coming back to New York for third grade because I no longer spoke English well, so my English teacher helped me improve and it worked. In Ghana, I spoked Ga and Tree, two African languages.</p>

  <p>What motivates me is my mom. My mom motivates me because she is very hard working and also a single parent so she works hard to support four children. Even though my two older sisters are old enough to support themselves, my mom still looks out for them to make sure they have everything they need. What excites me is life I guess. I don’t know what’s going to happen next so it often leaves me curious.</p>
