<p> My name is Cheyanne Konate, I am 14 years old going into the 8th grade. My dream is to be involved in media or music entertainment. Some say I talk a lot, so becoming a writer come to mind also. A hobbie that I enjoy is writing songs, it helps me express myself an easier way. My favorite color is blue and pink. I like blue because its very exicting and calming to me. I like pink because I just think its a pretty color. </p>
	<p>I am exited to be a waves of change intern because I like to write and this program involves a lot of writing, so waves a change helps me learn more about a lot I didnt know. What makes me proud of myself is that I like to be involoved in a lot of programs because I know it will help me in the future. I was always told to take advantage of what comes my way but only for good. What gets me up in the morning is that I know I have a lot to see in the future. I have a lot of dreams and I want to be able to tell people how I did it and why. </p>
	<p> I used to go to school at Annunciation School but sadly it got closed down because it didnt have enough money to keep on. So now I attend St. Gregory the Great which is a Cathloic school. </p>
	<p>My family is from Accra, Ghana. When I was six, I went to school there for one year. I ended up getting held back coming back to new york for 3 third grade because I no longer spoke well english so my english teacher help me improve it and it worked. In Ghana I spoked Ga and Tree which are African languages. </p>
	<p>What motives me is my mom. My mom motives me because she is verying hard working and also a single parnet so she works hard to support four childern. Even though my two older sisters are old enough to support themselves, my mom still looks out for them to make sure they have everything they need. What exites me is life I guess. I dont know whats gonna happen next so it often leaves me curious.</p>
