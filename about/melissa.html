<div class="main-content">

	<p>Here goes,</p>

	<p>I'm Dominican-American, but I am also many things. I’m a writer (couldn’t do much with feelings if I
	couldn’t write), since I love writing short stories and poems and spoken word. I'm an actor, I love
	theatre. I'm also a guitarist and a singer and songwriter. I'm gonna be a Christian rock star, don't doubt
	it.</p>

	<p>I have so many dreams that sometimes I honestly cannot comprehend how I’ll deal with them. The
	ultimate life goal for me is to become a rock star, and it is no joke. Since a child in elementary school I’ve
	taken up the guitar, and I’ve been singing since forever. There is nothing I’ve wanted more than to live by
	the music that God’s blessed me with. I feel I’ve lived so much in this world, with the knowledge and
	education and the work experience I’ve received with the several jobs & internships where I’ve been able to
	work. I feel lucky to be able to embrace what it is to be blessed with so many opportunities and
	gateways.</p>

	<p>I’ve been constantly moving since I was a child, but everywhere I go, I strive to make an impact with my
	personality, leadership, friendship, and loyalty. I recently graduated from <a href="www.cityas.org">City-As High School</a> in June 2013. For my post education goals, I will be attending <a href="www.bcc.cuny.edu">Bronx Community College</a> as a undergraduate freshman this fall, in Bronx, New York. I plan to work up to transferring to a university or college in the <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/u0WRz">south of the United Kingdom</a>. It’s been my goal to go to England since the beginning of high school, and now I’m only a few steps away.</p>

	<p>While interning at City-As High School, I got to experience oh-so-many different environments
	and moments. My first internship was at <a href="www.plj.com">WPLJ 95.5 FM</a> as a promotional assistant. After that I interned at <a href="www.harlemflowers.com">Barbara’s Flowers</a> as a florist’s assistant. My penultimate internship was at <a href="www.shininghopeforcommunities.org">Shining Hope for Communities</a> as an administrative assistant intern. My last internship was at <a href="www.hsny.org">The Horticultural Society of New York</a> as a special events intern. Right now, I'm working at Waves of Change as an intern and am hoping this can be a very fulfilling internship for me. All these experiences added together were a humongous help to my career goals; although they may not exactly be direct, they’ve definitely been a great insight and preview of some of the things that I might want to taste. As a result of all these internships I do feel more suited for the what is considered to be the “real world” because of the experience and new skills I’ve gained and I’m more likely to be a better fit for certain jobs because of these experiences.</p>

	<p> To conclude, I LOVE Japanese Pop-Culture, Manga, Fashion, Cosplay; Anything with any sort of anime flare is on my love
	list. Ex: Sanrio, Gothic Lolita, Anime, you name it! Video games like Final Fantasy also hold an extremely
	special place in my heart. Reading all sorts of books, comedy, and skyping are just a few of the things I
	love to do just for the gist of who I am.</p>

	<p>See ya on the flipside,</p>
