<div class="main-content">
 <p>My name is Nafretiry Philippe; and I currently attend Mott Hall High School. This fall, I will enter the 11th grade. I plan to graduate high school with an advanced regents diploma. A long-term goal I have is to pass my bar and attend law school. I plan to attend either Stony Brook or Syracuse University; I want to go away but not too far. My hobbies are writing and exercising; I like to walk and run around. My activities including extracurricular are attending the <a href="http://www.heaf.org/"> HEAF (Harlem Education Activities Fund)</a> program afterschool and also attending the <a href="http://www.urbanscholarsny.org/">Urban Scholars </a> Program for tutoring and sometimes summer programs. In addition, I do a lot of activities with my church such as praise dancing and singing with the choir and some volunteer work.</p>

 <p>I have a few favorites but not too many. My favorite food is macaroni and cheese, my favorite subject in school is English; my favorite color is purple; my favorite movies are My Sister's Keeper, Freedom writers, and The Great Gatsby; My favorite places are Disney World, Haiti, The Bahamas and France.</p>

  <p>My parents were born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. My Father was raised partly in Haiti and partly in the Dominican republic; My mom was born and raised in Haiti and then she came to the USA. My parents speak Haitian, Creole, and French; my father also speaks Spanish. I speak Creole, English, and a little Spanish; I am also learning French at home. A fun fact about me is that I have a large family. They are spread across the world from D.R. and Haiti to Miami, Japan, China, France, etc.</p>

  <p>What most excites me about the Waves of Change internship program is the journalism because I love to write and it’s amazing how I will be able to inform others based on my writing. What wakes me up in the morning is God; my family and I are Christians and I think if I get to see another day I thank God. What motivates me is seeing how a lot of women have had to fight in history to get a word out to get a voice; In a way I think if they could do it why can’t I. What makes me proud of myself is when I accomplish things I never thought I could do: I don't only just do it, I do it with all my effort and it ends up being great which puts a smile on my face.</p>
