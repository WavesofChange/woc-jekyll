    <strong>Deep Dish Waves of Change</strong> Summer 2013 Internship worked with seven high school women from Community District 9 in Harlem, NY. Throughout the six-week internship program our interns learned about community media, photography, videography, web development and design. They documented organizations in Harlem and built this website.
