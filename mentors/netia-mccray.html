  <h1>Netia McCray</h1>
  <h2>A fearless entrprenerur</h2>
  <p>I first met Netia in San Francisco. She was speaking at the Lean Conference and she caught my attention. Her work was similar to teaching I'd done in the Dominican Republic; she attended my once dream university; and she was one few women and women of color.</p>
  <p>I tweeted at her. We met for a drink. And we've kept in touch. I was thrilled when she agreed to speak to our Wave of Change interns on her path as a black, female entrepreneur.</p>
