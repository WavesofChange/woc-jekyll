	<h1>Colombia's Expansion in Harlem</h1>

	<p> <a href="www.colombia.edu"> Colombia University of the City of New York</a> was established prior to the American Revolution in 1754; it is the oldest higher level institution in the state of New York. At first, the university was named Kings College but in 1896, after the institution became placed under a private board of trustees, it's name was changed to Colombia University. Also in 1896, the university moved its location from Madison Avenue to the Morning side heights area of Manhattan. Statistically speaking, Colombia's campus is made up of 6 city blocks, but in actuality Colombia University owns the majority of the Harlem community. </p>

	<p> With the birth of new careers and majors, Colombia University has had to face a tough decision, expanding in an urban environment. In December 2007, the <a href="www.westharlemdc.org">West Harlem Development Corporation</a> agreed to support the educational expansion of Colombia and the Harlem community as a whole. In 2009 the university was planning to reconstruct 17 acres of land. </p>

	<p> Since then, Colombia has gone on to claim buildings and lands that are not rightfully theirs. In the 1980s, an Eritrean community center opened up on 125th and Broadway. The community center was the perfect place for tri-state area Eritreans to unite and enjoy the presence of one another. The site was not very far away from the Eritrean church (which is also on 'Colombia land') so Sundays were always something the community looked forward to. </p>

	<p> In 2008, the Eritrean people received word that their community center had been bought by Colombia. They were given one year to fully evacuate the premises, in fact, Colombia wanted them out as soon as possible. By mid-2009, their beloved community center was completely empty and left for the owners. ></p>

	<p> Now in 2013, almost 4 years later, the grounds of the Eritrean community center of Greater New York still lies untouched by Colombia University. And thus the famous question of 'why were these people asked to leave?' Is still unanswered. </p>
