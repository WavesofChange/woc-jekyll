<p> Nefy and I are working on this project together. We will be photographing areas in Harlem that show the Hip-Hop and African culture. We're trying to see if both cultures merge together or stay separate. Some shots we're thinking of capturing are the drums playing on 125th and Lenox as well as the Muslim youth on 116th and Lenox. We plan to observe our surroundings more than we usually do. We're keeping an eye out for African fabric stores and the latest Hip-Hop fashion trends. </p>

The dance gets it's name from a young girl named Manjani who was the best best dancer from her village in Guinea in the 1950's. </p>

<h3> Guinea Lamban </h3>

<p> Lamban is a celebratory dance performed by the Mande people of Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, the Gambia and Senegal. Lamban was created as music on the balafon by and for djelis to celebrate their role as keepers of the oral tradition. Traditionally lamban was performed in the courts of kings or to announce the arrival of a king to a village.  Currently lamban is danced to celebrate rites of passages such as birth, circumcision, puberty, weddings and death. Guinea lamban is a faster, more spirited version of lamban. </p>
