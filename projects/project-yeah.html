	<p>Young Empowered Artists of Harlem, or Y.E.A.H., located on 126th Street, aims to bring 15 teenagers each from Grant Houses and Manhattanville Houses together for work on a visual arts initiative, which Roy Secord, who runs the nonprofit, described as a large anti-violence mural.</p> 
  <p>Waves of Change is documenting the project. We're producing a stop-motion video of the transformation of the space as the students build a mural. We're also interviewing the partipants</p>
